# SignShop  
  
SignShop allows you to set up physical shops by punching a chest with your items you want to sell and then punching a sign, all while holding redstone dust. It's easy to set up, and even easier to customize!  
  
### About  
  
This repo is forked from [wargamer/SignShop](https://github.com/wargamer/SignShop) and is very much only an update to fix broken/deprecated methods and class references so it works in 1.13+ (tested 1.15.2).
A few hooks have been deleted, but all hooks have not been tested. Please test hooks yourself should you need them.
